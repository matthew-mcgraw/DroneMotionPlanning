# DroneMotionPlanning
Motion Planning Project for a drone through 3D environments

Initially this project was created as my Final Project for Motion Planning at CU Boulder, using the SST Motion Planning Algorithm I had written in Python to determine proper drone trajectories in order to follow a snowboarder through dense forestry.
